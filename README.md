# Hostlink
It makes managing software on your machines very easy.

## Installation

Just like it, the installation is also very simple.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selfhost-dev/hostlink/refs/heads/main/scripts/linux/install.sh | sudo sh
```

Just running this above script will make the server up and running on your
machine. You can access it on port :1232 of your machine.
